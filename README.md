# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

The objective of this exercise is to classify the box images whether it is a 'good' or a 'bad'using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We will also be discussing the CNN models used and model selection process to come up with the solution.

## Installation

The notebook was created using Python 3 notebook of Google Colab which runs Python 3.6 at its backend.

Modules:
tensorflow (Version: 1.13.1)

`pip install --upgrade tensorflow`

keras (Version: 2.2.4)

`pip install keras`

pandas (Version: 0.24.2)

`pip install pandas`

numpy (Version: 1.16.4)

`pip install numpy`

matplotlib (Version: 3.0.3)

`pip install matplotlib`

cv2 (Version:3.4.3)

`pip install opencv-python`


## Usage

#### ImageClassification.ipynb 

The Notebook contains all the codes with discussions on the project objectives, methodology and results. The codes in the notebook are in chunks so that whenever the user will only run one chunk of code, all packages that needs to be loaded are sure in the code.


#### finalmodel.py 

This is the python script used to generate the final model after the model selection process. This will yield the same result as the other model scripts as seen in the notebook

#### modelpredict.py 

This is the python script used to predict using the model from *finalmodel.py.*
